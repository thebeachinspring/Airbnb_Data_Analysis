## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project we were required to answer 3 question from the data; the dataset I chose were the Seattle and Boston Airbnb datsets. The questions that I found most interesting from the data were:
1. Which areas get the best rental rates? Help new host understand if thier property is in a wanted aread 
2. Which properties get the best rental rates? This will help new host understand the best selling point of thier property 
3. How well can we predict the listing price?  Estimating how much thier propery is worth and how much they could make
