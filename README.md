## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project we were required to answer 3 questions from the data. The dataset I chose was the Seattle and Boston Airbnb datsets. The questions that I found most interesting from the data were:
1. Which areas get the best rental rates? This will help me know if I'm in a high price area 

2. What are the best types of property to rent? This will give an idea of what people are looking for

3. What are the most important features for predicting price? This gives an idea of what gets the best price
