## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project we were required to answer 3 question from the data; the dataset I chose were the Seattle and Boston Airbnb datsets. The questions that I found most interesting from the data were:
1. Which areas get the best rental rates? This will help me know if i'm in a high price area 

2. How well can we predict the listing price? Estimating how much a propery is worth

3. What are the most important features for predicting price? Give an idea of what people are looking for in a property
